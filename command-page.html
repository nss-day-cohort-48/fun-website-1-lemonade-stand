                <p class="info__description-text">Terminal, sometimes referred to as <em>console</em> or
                    <em>command line</em>, is a built-in tool that allows you to type instructions in order
                    to navigate and modify content on your computer. With it, you can explore, change, and delete
                    directories, files, and other apps and programs. The terminal not only
                    accesses your local computer, but can also connect and sync to online accounts. For web developers,
                    the most common external program that is used in tandem with terminal is gitHub. See links below for
                    more information on what gitHub is and how to use it.
